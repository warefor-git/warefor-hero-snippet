                            <p>A rapidly growing consumer products brand experienced explosive demand across major U.S. marketplaces after its products went viral online. While sales surged, traditional fulfillment options became increasingly expensive and restrictive, especially under strict one-day and two-day delivery requirements imposed by marketplace platforms.</p>
                            <p>To maintain service levels and protect margins, the brand needed to:</p>

                                <li>Establish a U.S.-based fulfillment network</li>
                                <li>Meet Seller-Fulfilled Prime (FBM) delivery standards</li>
                                <li>Ensure reliable, seven-day-a-week order processing</li>
                                <li>Maintain real-time visibility without being physically present</li>
