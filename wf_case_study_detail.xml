Large volumes of inbound containers were accumulating in costly storage yards, delaying inventory visibility and restricting product flow across their distribution network.</p>
                            <p>The retailer urgently needed to:</p>
                            <ul class="wf-cs-list">

                                <li>Restore throughput across their supply chain under extreme time pressure</li>
