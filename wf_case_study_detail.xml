                            <p>During the height of the pandemic, a major national big-box retailer faced severe congestion at U.S. ports. Large volumes of inbound containers were accumulating in costly storage yards, delaying inventory visibility and restricting product flow across their distribution network.</p>
                            <p>The retailer urgently needed to:</p>
                            <ul class="wf-cs-list">
                                <li>Rapidly unload and process containers</li>
                                <li>Receive the merchandise into their systems for visibility &amp; inventory control</li>
                                <li>Restore throughput across their supply chain under extreme time pressure</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>A short-term engagement evolved into a 2.5-year operational partnership.</p>
                            <p>Warefor's execution drew recognition from senior leadership and operations teams, including multiple on-site visits to review best-practice warehouse processes. The operating model developed during this engagement was later referenced as a benchmark for other third-party logistics providers supporting similar initiatives.</p>
