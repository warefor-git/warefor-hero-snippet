                            <p>A fast-growing international cookware brand achieved strong success selling online through major U.S. marketplaces. However, expanding into brick-and-mortar retail presented a fundamentally different set of challenges.</p>
                            <p>Unlike e-commerce, selling through physical stores requires:</p>
                            <ul class="wf-cs-list">
                                <li>Rigid compliance with retailer-specific logistics and data standards</li>
                                <li>Store-ready packaging that protects the product while presenting well on the shelf</li>
                                <li>Flawless item setup, where minor errors can cascade into costly downstream issues</li>
                                <li>Deep understanding of legacy retail systems and processes unfamiliar to many manufacturers operating abroad</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>When a leading U.S. big-box retailer invited the brand to begin selling in stores, the brand was referred to Warefor to support the transition.</p>
